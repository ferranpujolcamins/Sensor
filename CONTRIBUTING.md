# Contributing to Sensor

Sensor is built with Swift Package Manager. We generate `Sensor.xcodeproj` with Swift Package Manager commit the changes in git. Sensor is compatible with linux, so we must make sure that the tests can be run there.

**After you change Sensor code, make sure to:**
1. Generate `Sensor.xcodeproj` with the following command:
`swift package generate-xcodeproj --enable-code-coverage`
2. Generate `LinuxMain.swift` with the following command:
`swift test --generate-linuxmain`
3. Commit the changes generated by the commands above.
