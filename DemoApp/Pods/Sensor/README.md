# LoginRxReduxDemo
Coding for iOS is evolving more and more. MVVM, Viper, Clean Architecture are patterns that help in writing more legible, testable and beautiful code. When you add Rx and Redux to the mix unidirectional data flow and flawless state handling are achieved effortlessly. As a team you have to find something that is powerful but controllable, defined yet open for changes, concise but readable. In this talk we want to reveal our architecture and the way we are writing code at mytaxi. The things that we learned along the way, where we are right now and the road that is still  ahead of us!

[You can see a video with a presentation of this architecture here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp2LQo2DOcg&t=15s)
